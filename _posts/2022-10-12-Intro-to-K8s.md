# Introduction to Kubernetes

## || Container Management ||
* Container management is the process of organizing, adding, removing, or updating a significant number of containers.
## || Kubernetes and  it's architecture ||
* Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
* A Kubernetes cluster contains at least one main plane and one or more nodes. Both the control planes and node instances can be physical devices, virtual machines, or instances in the cloud.
* The default host OS in Kubernetes is Linux, with default support for Linux-based workloads.

***Control plane components***

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

**Controller manager** ensure the desired PodSpec is being satisfied.

some types of controllers:
* Node controller
* route controller
* job controller
* service controller

**Kube API server** is the interface of control plane. Anyone(users/dashboard) wants communicate with k8s, has to go through API server.

**etcd** is consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

**Kube Scheduler** handles pod creation and management. It decides which service to run in which container ex:- CPU intensive services to run in CPU optimized containers etc.

***Worker node components***

* *Kubelet* is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster and monitors work requests from the API server. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.

* *kube-proxy* maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

* *Container runtime* is responsible for running containers on a kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes such as Docker, containerd, rkt, podman, RunC, frakti.
* The support for many container runtime types is based on the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). The CRI is a plug-in design that enables the kubelet to communicate with the available container runtime.
